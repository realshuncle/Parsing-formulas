# Parsing-formulas

This is a tutorial project. The program is a simple calculator. It is designed to calculate simple formulas. There is support for the operations: "+", "-", "*", "/", as well as parentheses: "(", ")". Both whole numbers and decimal fractions can be used as operands.

While working on the project, I mastered the basics of C ++ syntax, such as:
* classes
* constructors
* cycles
* destructors
* exceptions and their handling
* functions
* inheritance
* logical operations
* pointers
* templates
* working with the command line
* and so on

The following data structures have also been implemented:
* binary tree
* stack
